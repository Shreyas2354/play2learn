# **App Name**: EduQuest: STEM Adventures

## Core Features:

- Interactive Story Quizzes: Presents STEM questions within engaging narrative missions; includes hints provided by an LLM tool that responds to the question content and hints provided, adapting the tool's helpfulness to prior student performance. Multiple-choice format, immediate feedback.
- Adaptive Difficulty Engine: Algorithmically adjusts question difficulty based on the student's previous answers and performance in that question type. Levels automatically change according to student performance and adapt based on overall learning ability.

- Offline Multiplayer Mockup: A simulated interface demonstrating how offline multiplayer challenges would work, showing how student data is tracked when completed later, and showing competitive team leaderboards.
- Teacher Analytics Dashboard Mockup: A simplified teacher dashboard visualizing student performance and identifying weak areas in the form of mockup interfaces and example reports.
- Interactive STEM Experiments: Step-by-step interactive instructions, using clear descriptive visuals for a selected hands-on, low-cost STEM kit experiment.
